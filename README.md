# DFS_and_BFS_tree_traversal

This program mimics the search function seen in file systems using a tree and traversing via Depth First Search and Breadth First Search.
This program uses a test tree made from scratch with dummy variables as practice for DFS and BFS.

Depth First Search (DFS) is a traversal algorithm for a tree or graph that starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. 

Breadth First Search (BFS) is a traversal algorithm for a tree that starts at the tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.


The DFS implementation uses recursion as opposed to a typical stack and the BFS implementation uses a queue. Both implementations were made using only pseudocode as a reference, and the exact implementations are my own.
